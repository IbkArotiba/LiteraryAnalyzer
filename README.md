This project is designed to analyze and discern the main topics of discussion in literary texts, with a focus on identifying key noun and verb phrase chunks. By processing the text through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it extracts meaningful patterns that reveal the author's thematic interests and beliefs.

Features:
Tokenization: Breaks down text into words and sentences.
POS Tagging: Labels parts of speech to identify key phrases.
Chunk Parsing: Analyzes noun and verb phrases in the text.
Topic Extraction: Discerns frequently occurring noun and verb phrase chunks to infer central themes.
Technologies:
NLTK for Natural Language Processing
Regular Expressions for chunk parsing
